    "1. **Creating a Bokeh plot**: You can create a Bokeh plot in Python by importing the necessary modules from Bokeh and defining your plot using the `figure()` function. You can then add various components to the plot such as glyphs, axes, titles, and legends. Finally, you can show or save the plot using the `show()` or `save()` functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Glyphs in Bokeh**: Glyphs in Bokeh are visual shapes such as lines, circles, squares, etc., that represent data points on the plot. You can add glyphs to a Bokeh plot using the `plot()` function along with specifying the type of glyph and the data source. For example, to add circles to a plot:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from bokeh.plotting import figure, show\n",
    "\n",
    "# Create a Bokeh plot\n",
    "p = figure()\n",
    "\n",
    "# Add circles glyph\n",
    "p.circle([1, 2, 3, 4, 5], [6, 7, 2, 4, 5], size=20)\n",
    "\n",
    "# Show the plot\n",
    "show(p)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Customizing the appearance**: You can customize various aspects of a Bokeh plot including axes, title, and legend by setting properties of the plot object. For example, to customize the title and axes labels:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "p.title.text = \"My Custom Plot\"\n",
    "p.xaxis.axis_label = \"X-axis Label\"\n",
    "p.yaxis.axis_label = \"Y-axis Label\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Bokeh server for interactive plots**: Bokeh server is a server application that allows you to create interactive plots with real-time updates. You can use Bokeh server by defining a Bokeh application in Python and running it using the `bokeh serve` command. This allows you to create dynamic plots that can be updated based on user interactions or data changes.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Embedding Bokeh plot into web page or dashboard**: You can embed a Bokeh plot into a web page or dashboard using frameworks like Flask or Django. This involves creating a route in your web application that serves the Bokeh plot as an HTML document generated by Bokeh. You can then include this HTML document in your web page or dashboard template."

    "Descriptive statistics: Descriptive statistics is the branch of statistics that involves summarizing and describing data using numerical measures and graphical representations. It is used to provide a snapshot of the data and to identify patterns and trends.\n",
    "Example: Suppose you are a business owner and want to know how much money your company earned last year. You would use descriptive statistics to calculate the mean (average) income, the median income (the middle value of all the incomes), and the standard deviation (a measure of the spread of the data around the mean) of your company's income.\n",
    "\n",
    "Inferential statistics: Inferential statistics is the branch of statistics that involves making inferences and drawing conclusions about a population based on a sample of data. It is used to test hypotheses and make predictions.\n",
    "Example: Suppose you want to know if a new medication is effective in reducing blood pressure. You would conduct a study where you randomly assign some people to receive the medication and some to receive a placebo, then measure their blood pressure before and after the treatment. You would use inferential statistics to determine if the difference in blood pressure between the two groups is statistically significant, and if so, conclude that the medication is effective in reducing blood pressure.\n",

    "Qualitative data can be further divided into two types: nominal and ordinal data.\n",

    "Nominal data: Nominal data is categorical data where data is assigned to different categories. It has no inherent order or rank.\n",
